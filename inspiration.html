        There are probably thousands of styles of tattoos around now, with
        talented artists creating their own every day. But a lot of those
        designs are adapted from certain historically popular tattoo styles—many
        of them decades or even centuries old. Here are twelve of the classic
        styles of tattoo art, the ones you definitely want to know before you
        start getting into tattoo design. If you’re looking for the perfect
        tattoo style, you may not be able to use the exact terminology of what
        you want, but in all likelihood you’ll have one of these in mind
        already. Figuring out how exactly you want your perfect tattoo to look
        like is hard, but we hope the styles below will help you narrow it down.
        Here are the 3 most popular, classic tattoo styles:

        <h2>Classic Americana Tattoo</h2>

        <p class="text">
          These may be the first kind of tattoo you think of, an old-school
          style defined by bold outlines and the use of similar colors and
          imagery. They’re closely tied to the ocean and nautical imagery, pinup
          female figures, fierce predatory animals, or combinations of hearts,
          roses, and daggers. The tattoo style was popularized by Norman “Sailor
          Jerry” Collins in the 1930s, but is a consistent choice today—shown
          here by Frankie Caraccioli of Kings Avenue Tattoo.

        <h2>New school tattoo style</h2>

        <p class="text">
          New School tattoos are like a crazy comic book on your body. Jesse
          Smith‘s work is famous in this category, depicting fabulous imagined
          worlds full of chaos and very often chariactured animals in vivid
          color.

        <h2>Japanese tattoo style</h2>
        <img class="foto" src="Japanese.avif" />
        <p class="text">
          There are centuries of history for the art tattooing all over the
          world. One that has maintained it’s popularity is the Japanese style
          Irezumi. Tattoo artists still create both traditional and new takes on
          these classic masterpieces. And it’s a genre particularly known for
          large images that cover the back, arms, and legs. Here, Chris
          O’Donnell of New York shows off the traditional animal, floral, and
          samurai imagery of this style.
