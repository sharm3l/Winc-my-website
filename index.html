      <h1>Tattoo</h1>
      <p>
        A tattoo is a form of body modification made by inserting tattoo ink,
        dyes, and/or pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis
        layer of the skin to form a design. Tattoo artists create these designs
        using several tattooing processes and techniques, including hand-tapped
        traditional tattoos and modern tattoo machines. The history of tattooing
        goes back to Neolithic times, practiced across the globe by many
        cultures, and the symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different
        places and cultures. Tattoos may be decorative (with no specific
        meaning), symbolic (with a specific meaning to the wearer), or pictorial
        (a depiction of a specific person or item). Many tattoos serve as rites
        of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual
        devotion, decorations for bravery, marks of fertility, pledges of love,
        amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of
        outcasts, slaves and convicts. Extensive decorative tattooing has also
        been part of the work of performance artists such as tattooed ladies.
        Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic,
        sentimental/memorial, religious, and spiritual reasons, and to symbolize
        their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including
        criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or
        law-abiding subculture. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a
        relative (commonly a parent or child) or about an unrelated person.[1]
        Tattoos can also be used for functional purposes, such as
        identification, permanent makeup, and medical purposes.
